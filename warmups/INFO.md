# Notes
Based on [Intro to Programing by Princeton U](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11hello)

## To run java programs
1. `javac MyProgram.java` will create a file with the `.class` extension
2. `java MyProgram.java` will run the program
3. `java MyProgram [input]` will run the program with specified argument string
    > note that scanners will require you to run the program first before entering the desired input

## Naming conventions
> Probably referencing a third party source (like [this](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-namingconventions.html)) would be useful
- file name should probably match with the classname
- uses PascalCase
